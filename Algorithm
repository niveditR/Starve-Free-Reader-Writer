#Algorithm Psuedo Code

==>Writers

wait(mutex);
writecount++;
signal(mutex);
wait(resource);

//performs the write

wait(mutex);
writecount--;
signal(mutex);
signal(resource)

==>Readers

wait(mutex);
if(writecount>0 || readcount==0)
	signal(mutex);
	wait(resource);
	wait(mutex);

readcount++;
signal(mutex);

//performs the read

wait(mutex);
readcount--;
if(readcount==0)
	signal(resource);
signal(mutex);


-------------Explanation---------------

Writers: First wait(mutex) is called before writecount so it can avoid incorrectness of writecount. After increasing the writecount it checks if resource is 
available or not. If available performs writing else waits. After performing writing it checks for mutex that decrement can be done. Finally, it signals mutex
and resource so that others can use it.

Readers: First read(mutex) is called. And, if allowed to enter checks the condition of writecount>0 or readcount==0. It checks for the resource, if available
calls wait(mutex) as it getting the required resource. After that readcount is updated and then reading is performed. After the reading process is finished, it 
is required to decrease the readcount and thus calls wait(mutex). Now it checks if readcount is 0 or not i.e. if some reading action is still going on and if 
it is 0 then signals that the resource is free and available for others to use.
